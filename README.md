# **Benchmarking Knowledge Transfer for Lifelong Robot Learning**

This repo is forked from the original repository **LIBERO** by Bo Liu, Yifeng Zhu, Chongkai Gao, Yihao Feng, Qiang Liu, Yuke Zhu, Peter Stone. You can access the original repo [here](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO).

The repo is used to evaluate VLA models such as NVIDIA's GR00T N1.5 on LIBERO with some modifications on the original code. The evaluation code for NORA, Pi-0, and GR00T can be accessed in this [repo](https://github.com/davidjjeong/vla_test).
